      The main current research interests concern the role eventually played 
      by classical and quantum electrodynamics interactions in the dynamical 
      organization of biomolecular systems. In this framework, I recently 
      focused my attention on the possible role played by many-body van-der-Waals 
      interactions in the biomolecular allosteric pathways and on how such 
      interactions may contribute to affect the mechanical response of biomolecules 
      in THz and far-IR domain out-of-thermal equilibrium in an aqueous environment. 
      Moreover, I am interested to apply the existing geometrical formulations of 
      quantum mechanics to characterize van-der-Waals dispersive interactions 
      in many-body quantum systems.

      My current research interests focus on the effect of many-body dispersion interactions on 
      the stability, dynamics, and functionality of (bio)molecules and their complexes in gas phase 
      and (aqueous) solvation. This includes the fundamental understanding of van-der-Waals interactions 
      in large-scale (bio)molecular systems as well as efficient and reliable modeling of 
      dispersion interactions at solute-solvent interfaces. In the course of my studies, we develop 
      novel techniques to characterize collective charge fluctuations and their impact on (bio)molecular 
      systems and materials. For this, we employ combined approaches of Density Functional Theory, 
      semi-empirical methods, and (many-body) dispersion models.
